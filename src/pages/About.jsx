      <h2 className="font-medium">About the DIRECTOR</h2>
      <p>
        Born and bred in Leeds, in the North of England, Victoria is a very
        proud British citizen. Having finished university in 2000, graduating in
        English and Theatre Studies, Victoria moved to Northern Portugal to
        pursue her teaching career and has been an ESL teacher ever since.
        Working in many different institutions and companies, teaching all ages
        and levels, she has built up a vast CV. In 2012, with 12 yearsâ€™
        experience under her belt, she decided to embark on her next challenge
        and opened up her own school, THE ENGLISH ACADEMY, something she had
        been thinking about doing for several years. For this venture, Victoria
        has had to turn her hand to many new things, principally the general
        day-to-day running of the Academy but continues to be the principal
        English teacher, which she considers to be her most important role.
        However, she believes that having both these responsibilities is
        essential as it helps in identifying the needs of the Academy and its
        students, making it easier to resolve any problems quickly and
        efficiently.
